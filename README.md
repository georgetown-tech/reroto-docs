## Editing Docs

To edit a page, first visit that page on [ReRoto Docs](https://docs.reroto.com). Then, click 'Edit this page on GitHub'. After that, make the edits that you would like and click 'commit'. After commit, you have to create a 'pull request', so that we can make sure your edits are good. And that's it!

*Please note, editing and adding pages requires a Github account.*

## Adding Pages

To add a page, go into the 'pages' directory. Then, duplicate an existing file in the directory, naming it whatever you would like the page to be named. Once created, you can edit the file and follow the "Editing Docs" instructions for the rest.
